## What to Do with Images

1. **Generate 4 Images:**
   - bulls-win.png (green)
   - bulls-loss.png (red)
   - bears-win.png (green)
   - bears-loss.png (red)

2. **Save to:** `/public/share-templates/`

3. **We'll update the code** to:
   - Pick the right template (army + profit/loss)
   - Overlay text dynamically
   - Much simpler and more reliable!

---

## Alternative: Just 2 Templates

If you want simplicity, create just:
- **win-template.png** (green gradient)
- **loss-template.png** (red gradient)

Use same for both armies, just change the text/emoji.

## Design Tips for Canva

1. **Keep center 60% clear** - that's where numbers go
2. **Darker edges, lighter center** - makes text pop
3. **Subtle patterns only** - don't overwhelm
4. **Professional look** - this represents your brand
5. **Test at small size** - will it look good as thumbnail?

## Quick Win Option

If Canva AI doesn't work well, just create:
- Solid gradient from dark green (#14532d) to darker slate (#0f172a)
- Solid gradient from dark red (#7f1d1d) to darker slate (#0f172a)

Simple gradients often look better than AI-generated complexity!
